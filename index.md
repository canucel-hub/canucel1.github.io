Hello! I’m Can. I’m interested in software, web, and design. I develop projects in Python, maintain this portfolio on GitHub Pages, and I love learning new things. I’m especially interested in ideas with social impact, such as security and accessibility. I recently started AP Computer Science and I’m progressing from the basics toward advanced topics.

Big Ideas
Big Idea 1.1

Computing projects are better when people work together. Teamwork leads to creative, fair, and useful products.

Big Idea 1.2

Computing innovations aim to solve problems or support creativity through planning, testing, and feedback.

Big Idea 1.3

Programs are built step by step: understanding needs, planning, designing, testing, and improving.

Big Idea 1.4

Programs may contain syntax, logic, runtime, or overflow errors. Testing and debugging improve correctness.

Big Idea 2.1

All data in computers is stored in binary (0s and 1s), allowing efficient storage and communication.

Big Idea 2.2

Data compression reduces file size.

Lossy: loses some information

Lossless: preserves all information

Big Idea 2.3

Data must be cleaned before use. Metadata is “data about data” (date, creator, format).

Big Idea 2.4

Programs analyze data, find patterns, and visualize results more accurately than humans alone.
