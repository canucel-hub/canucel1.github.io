    <h2>Documentation of Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scratch XOX Project :</strong> How it works:
 This is a tic-tac-toe (XOX) game built in Scratch where two players take turns placing ‚ÄúX‚Äù and ‚ÄúO‚Äù on a 3√ó3 board. 1 click for X, 2 clicks for O
What I have done:
 I created the board using Scratch buttons, added costumes and made change the costume everytime someone clicks. I also made the game restartable by clicking space or green flag so it can be played multiple times.
Was it hard?
Overall Scratch made it easier since it uses block coding.
</li>
    <li><strong>Swift XOX Project :</strong> How it works:
 This is another tic-tac-toe board, built in Swift Playgrounds but this one was only a board which is unplayable.
What I have done:
 I designed the board layout and the spaces between them and also added the X and O
Was it hard?
 It was harder than Scratch because I had to write the code myself instead of using blocks, but because it‚Äôs not working it was also easy.
</li>  
      <li><strong>Swift ClockV3 Project :</strong>How it works:
 This is a clock with Lego characters instead of numbers. The user can press buttons (-1 hour, +1 hour, -1 min, +1 min) to change the time. The background color changes automatically as time passes.
What I have done:
 I programmed the clock hands to rotate based on the time values and added interactive buttons for adjusting the time. I also created a color-changing function for the background.
Was it hard?
 Yes, connecting the time changes with both the clock rotation and background color was tricky, but I managed to make it work.
</li>  
      <li><strong> Swift ClockV5 Project :</strong> How it works:
 This is another version of the clock project. Instead of adjusting time manually, a button generates a random time, and the clock hands move to that position.
What I have done:
 I programmed a randomizer that selects an hour and minute, then updates the clock hands instantly.
Was it hard?
 Not very hard, since I had already learned from the previous version. The randomization was fun to add.
</li>  
    <li><strong> Swift Portrait Project :</strong>How it works:
 I created a digital self-portrait inside Swift Playgrounds by drawing shapes and lines.
What I have done:
 I used Swift code to draw my face, hair, and other details as a picture.
Was it hard?
 Yes, it was a little difficult because I had to figure out how to represent real features with code-based shapes, but it was also creative and fun and ƒ± had a guide.
