    <h2>Big Idea 1.1</h2>
    <p>Computing projects are better when people work together. Each person has different ideas and skills. Talking with users helps make sure the program meets their needs. Teamwork makes the final product more creative, fair, and useful.
</p>

    <h2>Big Idea 1.2</h2>
       <p> The goal of a computing innovation is to solve problems or help people be creative. Developers plan, test, and improve their programs using feedback. Good programs work well in many situations and are easy to use.
</p>
  <h2>Big Idea 1.3</h2>
    <p>Making a program happens step by step. First, developers learn what users need. Then they plan, design, test, and improve the program. Splitting big problems into smaller parts helps make better and more reliable programs.
</p>
  <h2>Big Idea 1.4</h2>
    <p> Programs can have mistakes like syntax, logic, run-time, or overflow errors. Developers test the program in different ways to find and fix them. Fixing errors makes the program work better and more correctly.
</p>
  <h2>Big Idea 2.1</h2>
    <p> All data in computers and on the Internet is stored in binary. Binary uses only 0 and 1 to represent information. Computers use binary because it is easy to show digitally. Binary can store text, numbers, images, videos, and sounds. It helps computers and the Internet store and send information efficiently.
</p>
  <h2>Big Idea 2.2</h2>
    <p> Data compression makes files smaller so they take less space and move faster. There are two main types: lossy and lossless. Lossy compression loses some information to make files smaller. Lossless compression keeps all the information, so the file can be restored completely.
</p>
  <h2>Big Idea 2.3</h2>
    <p> Before using data, it must be cleaned. Cleaning removes mistakes or missing information so the data is easier to use. Metadata is extra information about a file, like the date a video was made or the name of the person who recorded it. Metadata is data about data, not the main content.
</p>
  <h2>Big Idea 2.4</h2>
    <p> Programs can help us study and understand data. They can find patterns we might miss and make fewer mistakes than humans. Programs can also turn data into graphs, tables, or other visuals to make it easier to understand.
